# Introduction

The dataset I want to analyze is called “Nutrition Fact for McDonald’s Menu”, this dataset records every nutrition analysis of every menu item on the United States McDonald’s menu. This dataset contains 24 columns and 260 rows. Some existing visualizations analyze this dataset focusing on bar charts to compare between different variable rather than scatterplots which would identify the relationship between variables. I will be using this as an inspiration for the project where I would look at it in different aspects and potentially implement user’s interaction on my data visualization. My inspiration includes: What is the average calories of a McDonald’s meal? How does a McDonald’s meal fit into the recommended daily nutrient intake? Are the any correlations or relationships between different nutrients, for example, a positive relationship between total fat and sodium? If you have certain conditions (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc), what type of meal would you want to avoid at McDonalds?
